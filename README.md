My name is Tiago, I'm a computer science student and I'm developing this simple Java CRUD project just for studying proposes

How to run the project:
- Clone the project and import at Intellij IDEA
- Download H2 binary JAR from https://h2database.com/html/download.html
- Execute this SQL to create the tables (TODO)
- Upload maven dependencies
- Run Main.java
